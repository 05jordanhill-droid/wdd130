            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am an aspiring computer programmer from a small town in Missouri. When I was younger I found a passion for problem solving and as I got older this passion matured into an interest in programming. I was able to realize this interest once starting college and quickly found the field of programming to extremely satisfying. I am excited to dive into more programming projects as I continue to learn and grow!
