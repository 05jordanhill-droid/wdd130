    <h2>Client Report</h2>
        <p>
            How did you decide what content and images to use for your site plan?<br>
            I went with what came to mind and what I could imagine myself to be capable of doing, even if it would require me to do some research. It was a site plan in which I was passionate about the content therein.
<br><br>
            How did you communicate with your developer? Was there any issues with communication?<br>
            I would communicate via email and in-person talking. It was hard to find some of their emails and talking in-perosn was always way easier.
<br><br>
            Did your developer meet your expectations for your site?<br>
            My lead developer did amazing, though he did add some stuff that wasn't in the wireframe, it didn't detract from what I wanted.
            My 1st Junior Developer made the page according to the wirefram but has yet to include the actual content that would go into paragraph tags.
            My 2nd Junior Developer had some very understandable confusions about my design and I was able to clarfiy them immensely, though she has yet to actually fix the errors at this point.
<br><br>
            What will you do differently next time you hire a team to do a project for you?<br>
            I will include more detailed instructions in my wireframe, even it gets repetitive and tiresome, and I will be more diligent in checking in on the team.

    <h2>Lead Developer Report</h2>
        <p>
            How did you manage your development team and comunicate the tasks for your junior devs?<br>
            I reached out to them in-person and assigned them their pages to complete.
<br><br>
            How did you communicate with your client? Was there any issues?<br>
            I reached out to him in-person and recieved some desperatley needed clarification. The child pages made no sense in connection to the parent page, but I was able to find some kind of consensus with him.
<br><br>
            How did you handle publishing your clients site and sharing it with the client?<br>
            He published it and shared it with me, but as for my own site, I simply published it in settings and then shared it to the usernames of the team working on my site.
<br><br>
            How was your experience with managing your site with GitHub?<br>
            It was rather smooth in this managing as lead developer.

    <h2>Junior Developer Report</h2>
        <p>
            How did you communicate with your team lead? Was there any issues?<br>
            I communicated primarily over email but then most effectively in-person. There were no real issues.
<br><br>
            Did you know what was expected of you for each site?<br>
            I knew what was expected, yes.
<br><br>
            Were you able to contribute to your sites?<br>
            Yes, and I completed them.
<br><br>
            Did you run into any issues with GitHub and adding your changes to the sites?<br>
            No, I did not.

    <h2>General Experience and Reflections</h2>
        <p>
            My general experience was very smooth. There were a couple times when I forgot to split the timeline and then had trouble pushing the changes. The most trouble I had in the project was getting my images uploaded to my repo as the owner but I eventually figured that out. <br>
            This was a very enjoyable project and I have grown more and more akin to building websites. I love code and I love building with code, when I don't like a bit of code, I eventually do like it given the time and practice.
